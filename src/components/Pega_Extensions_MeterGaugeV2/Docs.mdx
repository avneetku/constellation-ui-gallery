# Overview

The Meter Gauge Component is a dynamic visualization tool for Pega Constellation applications. It displays a circular gauge with configurable intervals (e.g., Good, Warning, Danger), receiving input values directly from Pega. This component helps users quickly interpret data and make informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Interval Configuration**: Define custom intervals such as Good (0–60), Warning (60–100), and Danger (above 100). Intervals are dynamically fetched from a backend data source in Pega, ensuring flexibility.

- **Customizable Units**: Display units (e.g., km/h, %, °C) alongside the value, ensuring clarity in data representation.
- **Color-Coded Intervals**: Visual differentiation of ranges using colors (e.g., green for Good, yellow for Warning, red for Danger).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring consistent performance across devices.
- **Performance Optimization**: Lightweight and efficient, ensuring minimal impact on application performance.

## Deployment and Integration Instructions

## Data Configuration in Pega

1. Create a Data Type (e.g., GaugeConfiguration) with the following columns:
   - **Unit**: The unit of measurement (e.g., km/h, %, °C).
   - **Intervals**: JSON object defining intervals (e.g., `{"Good": "0-60", "Warning": "60-100", "Danger": ">100"}`).
   - **Value**: The current value to be displayed.

Example:
```json
{
  "Unit": "%",
  "Intervals": {"Good": "0-60", "Warning": "60-100", "Danger": ">100"},
  "Value": 75
}

### Component Configuration in Pega

Add the Meter Gauge Component to your UI using the following settings:
Data Page: Specify the Data Page (e.g., D_GaugeConfig.pxResults).
Value: Bind the component to the Value property.
Unit: Bind the component to the Unit property.
Intervals: Bind the component to the Intervals property.
Frontend Implementation
Use CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive and visually appealing gauge. The following React component implementation demonstrates how to render the Meter Gauge with dynamic intervals, color-coded ranges, and smooth animations.

Example Use Case for the Meter Gauge Component in Pega Constellation
The Meter Gauge component is versatile and can be utilized across various scenarios to enhance data visualization and support decision-making. Below are examples of practical use cases:

System Health Monitoring
Objective: Monitor server or application health metrics, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or disk space.
Intervals:
Good: 0–60% (Green)
Warning: 61–80% (Yellow)
Danger: 81–100% (Red)
Example Scenario: A system administrator monitors server CPU utilization through a dashboard. The Meter Gauge shows the CPU usage percentage in real-time, changing color to yellow or red as thresholds are crossed, allowing for proactive issue resolution.
